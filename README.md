# Letter Game (Name is WIP)
inspired heavily by Undertale battle bullet patterns

A game about dodging letters as they attack you!!! They form dangerous gangs called "words"!
They'll come at you in waves â€“ each member of the word showing off its strengths.

This is essentially a very short demo! Right now, there're only two levels.

## Controls

Use WASD or arrow keys to move. Your health is displayed in the bottom right corner.


### Possible Titles (I haven't decided)
- Skillful Skimming
- Bulliterate Hell
- Alphabet Attack
- Bulletters
- I ran out of ideas



### Pun Corner
- Your little square will get some real lex-ercise dodging these!
- Things may get sen-tense.
- I could only escape by the edge of my suffix!
- The letters P and B like to be ex-plosive.
