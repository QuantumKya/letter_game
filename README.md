# Letter-Dodging Game
inspired by Undertale battle bullet patterns

Each letter is ready to throw all it has at you!!! Dodge their attacks!
They'll team up into words (gangs of letters) and attack together, too!

This is in Demo form!!! Right now, there's only one level. Play it [here](https://quantumkya.github.io/letter_game/?level=bros).

Example:
The letters P and B like to be ex-plosive


## Possible Titles (I haven't decided)
- Skillful Skimming
- Bulliterate Hell
- Alphabet Attack
- Bulletters
- I ran out of ideas



## Pun Corner
Your little square will get some real lex-ercise dodging these!
Things may get sen-tense.
I could only escape by the edge of my suffix!
